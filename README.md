# Task Management System

## Overview
This Task Management System is a simple command-line application built in Python. I have written this to brush up my Python basics. 

## Features
- Add new tasks with title, description, due date, and priority
- Remove tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- List all tasks with their details

## Python Concepts Demonstrated
- Object-Oriented Programming (Classes and Objects)
- List manipulation
- User input handling
- Date and time operations
- Control structures (loops and conditionals)
- Basic error handling

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system
2. Download the `task_manager.py` file
3. Open a terminal or command prompt
4. Navigate to the directory containing `task_manager.py`
5. Run the command: `python task_manager.py`

## Future Enhancements
- Data persistence (saving tasks to a file)
- Task sorting by due date or priority
- Search functionality
- Graphical User Interface (GUI)
